  Scenario Outline: Verify file upload and contract term extraction
    Given I click the check out from the welcome window
    When I search the prompt "<prompt_user_search>" with follow-up query "<follow_up_query>" to generate a website
    And I should see the status "Completed" for the task
    And the compute points should not exceed 150k
    And I should deploy the website
    Then I upload the file and validate the database integrity
