      "These efects may influence users’ information-gathering and opinion-formation process substantially enough to impact the outcomes of close elections [13]. And in addition to their efects on users, search can reveal latent social or cultural trends; this has implications for improving ranking algorithms [41].",

Researchers can use it to benchmark against other elections or social media datasets, explore longitudinal changes in digital political campaigning, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions or regulations introduced after 2024.",
      "This paper explores the Media Participation Hypothesis, which posits that increased engagement with interactive media positively influences civic attitudes and behaviors over time.

      "A growing literature uses media data to explain perception and behaviour in the economic and political context.

Yet, even though scholars have investigated the capacity of fact-checking to reduce belief in misinformation, little evidence exists on the global effectiveness of this approach.",
      "Those countries have different political and media systems and report a wide variety of levels of trust in legacy media outlets. This study makes an important contribution to the literature on fact-checks by studying their effects on three levels: the source of the misinformation, the source of the fact-check, and the media context.",

      "Our research challenges theories (Kreiss 2017; Waisbord 2018) that in one way or another question the effectiveness of fact checking and journalism in a post-truth era in which opinions and emotions may have more relevance than facts in processes of interpreting reality.",

      "Abstract Despite its growing prominence in news coverage and public discourse, there is still considerable ambiguity regarding when and how fact-checking affects beliefs.

A popular narrative holds that Twitter played a decisive role in both recent American presidential elections and the United Kingdom’s “Brexit” referendum.

      "Such media effects are of special significance where they are intended by political or social stakeholders, aiming to alter public opinion or influence and mobilize voters.",
      "Do social influencers affect election outcomes? Social influencers can reach millions of people through social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. However, research on social influencers is scarce and it is unclear whether they can affect elections. I argue that social influencers can influence elections through their role as digital opinion leaders and their power ...",
      "One important factor in understanding the potential influence of media on political outcomes is individuals’ preexisting attitudes. Attitudes that existed before media exposure can be changed through media consumption, where much research focuses on the development of negative attitudes (e.g., [36 •,37]).",
      "This study contributes to research on social media by showing by investigating if Twitter content is a reliable election predictor by using data collected closer to the election, based on the sentiment presented on the tweets mentioning a party, if it could have affected positively or negatively the actual votes for that party.",
